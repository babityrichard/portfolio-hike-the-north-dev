        desc: "Just a couple of hours north-west from Montreal and north-east from Ottawa, Mont-Tremblant is a great detour for a few days outdoor fun whilst exploring eastern Canada. This 1,510- kilometre-squared playground is celebrated for its six rivers, 400 streams and lakes, sprawling Laurentians peaks, sandy beaches, canoe routes, and 40 species of mammals. There’s also 18 different hiking trails that span over 82 kilometres, a series of fantastic river routes for canoeists (the Méandres de la Diable route from Lac Chat to Mont de la Vache Noire is great if you have a half-day to spare), and hundreds of camping spots. The park has two supervised and serviced beaches: Crémaillère beach in the La Diable sector, and Lac-Provost beach in La Pimbina sector. The rock climbing-like Via Ferrata du Diable on the wall of the Vache Noire at the park’s entrance is a one-of-a-kind trail to allow newbies and advanced climbers to safely scale the mountain. You’ll be clipped into a steel cable running the length of the cliff as you tackle the built-in steps, beams, footbaths, walkways, and bridges overlooking the Diable River below."
