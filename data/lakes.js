        desc: "Although Lake Louise tends to get more attention, there’s nothing less captivating than Banff National Park’s Moraine Lake. The picture-perfect glacial fed lake sits in the Valley of the Ten Peaks at an elevation of more than 1,880 metres. Some may recognise the lake from adverts, video games or even log-in screens, though they don’t even come close to the real thing. In fact, it’s arguably one of the most photographed lakes in all of Canada. There are a number of walking trails surrounding the lake that offer spectacular views of the lake and the Valley of the Ten Peaks behind it. The lake is also the starting point of the Perren Route; an eight to ten hour climb to the Neil Colgan Hut."

        desc: "When thinking about seeing a lake perched right in front of a mountain, well that’s Berg Lake. Canada’s highest peak – Mount Robson – is right behind the stunning turquoise blue lake that is partially fed by a glacier. If that’s not enough, the lake is also surrounded by icebergs, even in the summer! Plus, the hike there is also quite spectacular, as it passes through the incredible Valley of a Thousand Waterfalls. The only way to reach Berg Lake is by hiking along the Berg Lake Trail that runs from a car park and up along the Robson River. The trail is 19 kilometres and there are campsites along the way."

It’s also possible to hike along the 44 kilometre Skyline Trail from the town to the lake. Maligne Lake is home to two Alberta registered historic buildings as well as three camping sites that are only accessible by canoe. From spring to autumn, boats run to the iconic Spirit Island."

Today, it’s overflowing with seven species of fish, including rainbow trout, white sturgeon, kokanee salmon and mountain whitefish. All year the Kootenay Lake Ferry crosses the lake between Kootenay Bay and Balfour that can carry a maximum of 80 vehicles and 250 passengers.

In fact, it’s so big that there are actually countries that are smaller than it. Lake Superior is shared with neighbouring USA, though one of its main attractions is on the Canadian side; the Lake Superior Provincial Park. The park is sits along the north-eastern shores of the lake is home to the famous Agawa pictograph, 11 hiking trails and three campgrounds. It’s not possible to walk around the 2,783 kilometres shoreline, but driving along its Great Lakes Circle Tour scenic route is very popular, and highly recommended. It’s the best way to enjoy the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and wildlife surrounding the lake."

It sits in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains at an elevation of 1,340 metres. Abraham Lake is not a big lake, but it’s an impressive one, what with its incredible blue colour. This is a result of the rock flour created by the mountains. One of the main reasons to visit the lake it so witness the formation of the frozen bubbles beneath its icy surface in the winter months. This odd natural phenomenon is caused by the rotting of plants in the lake, which release methane gas that can’t be released, forming bubbles."

Still, no matter when you visit Emerald Lake you’ll be impressed."
